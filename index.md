# CSE15L Lab Report 4

## Timing Tasks

- Type ```<ssh cse15lsp23xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu>``` to login into ```ieng6```.

We do not have to type the password after we ```<ssh>``` to sign into the ```ieng6``` acount since the github had already have the memory of the key that in the last lab we authorized our terminal connect to the ```github``` account. Therefore, this is why we do not have to type the password when signing in to the ```ieng6``` acount.

- ```<ls>``` and ```<cd>``` into lab7, we will see ListExample.java

- Testing to see if it is failed or succeed. We can see the testing is failed.
To test, use 

```
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests
```

Actually, we can use another quick way to testing.

We can just use ```<bash>```script to run the test. Type ```<bash grade.sh>``` and the testing will run. Of course, we should first create the grade.sh code to include all the thing we want for testing.

- The failing test displays that the error is in ListExamples.merge. To edit the file, use vim command line with the specific file the user want to edit.

- And we will go into the place like this

- We have to edit the index 1 to inndex 2 to make the code correct. First press ```<k>``` *6, ```<l>``` *7, press ```<x>``` to delete 1 and press ```<i>``` to acces insert mode so that the user can change 1 to 2. After that, press ```<esc>``` button, and then type ```:wq``` to save and quit from the file.

k: go up.

l: go left.

x: delete the character.

i: go into the insert mode.

esc: exit from the current mode.

:w : save.

:q : quit.

:wq: save and quit.

- After editing, test if the coding is failed or succeed! The result seems like the testing is succeed!
To test, use 

```
javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java
java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests
```

- After testing, we are going to commit the file. first type in ```<git commit>``` and we will see this.

- To access this, we can use ```<git add <File>>``` to success the commit.

- To check if the file is committed sucessfully, type ```<git status>``` to see the status

- Let's push the commit! However, I don't know why I could not push the commit. The message is as below:

I will try my best to find out the problem!

Could someone give me the hint to get some idea for this problem? Thank you so much!

This is my Lab report 4. Thanks for watching!
